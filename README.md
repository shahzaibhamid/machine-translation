# Machine-translation using huggingface and streamlit

![Machine learning expert and Data Scientist](https://github.com/shahzaibhamid/machine-translation/blob/main/MT.png)

## This repository contains machine translation with the help of transformers

To get started first you need to install the requirements from the requirement file,
You can build your docker image or just use pip install requirements.txt

### Other than this all of the repository is complete, now go to the terminal in jupyter lab and run the streamlit app by using
streamlit run app2.py
It will download the hugging face model, give it a little time for the first time.

### If implementation is through docker than a new file cache.py can also be used to save the model in the docker conatiner. It will make the computation fast.
